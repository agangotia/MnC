Missionary and Cannibals Problem Solution
Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of the river, along with a boat
that can hold at most two people. Find a way to get everyone from one side of the
river to the other side of the river, without leaving any group of missionaries (on
either side of the river or in the boat) outnumbered by the cannibals in that place.

This is a JAVA implementation of the solution.
